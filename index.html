            <p>Indigenous tribes across Brazil cultivated and consumed cassava, also known as <em>manioc</em> or <em>yuca</em>, long before the arrival of European colonizers. Cassava provided sustenance and versatility, offering a reliable source of carbohydrates in various forms.</p>
            <p>Farofa likely emerged as a creative way to make the most of cassava flour, especially in regions where it was abundant. Early versions of farofa were simple mixtures of toasted cassava flour, often seasoned with salt or other available ingredients. Over time, as culinary influences intermingled (as Brazil has always been a incredibly culturally rich country), farofa evolved into a more elaborate and flavorful dish.</p>

            <p>During the colonial period, enslaved Africans brought to Brazil contributed to the development of Farofa by introducing new spices, techniques, and ingredients. The addition of ingredients like onions, garlic, bacon, and meats added depth and richness to Farofa, transforming it into a beloved accompaniment to meals across social classes.</p>
            <p>Farofa's popularity continued to soar throughout Brazil's history, adapting to regional preferences and cultural influences along the way. In the northeastern states of Brazil, for example, Farofa might include ingredients like dried shrimp or coconut, reflecting the coastal flavors of the region. In the southern states, Farofa might be more savory, featuring ingredients like sausage or beef jerky.</p>

              This is a recipe that tastes like my childhood. No other sound takes me back to my childhood as hearing my mother crushing the garlic at the kitchen pestle!

              A pretty standard farofa recipe, but packed with flavor and love!

          <ul class="recipe-ingredients">
            <li>1kg of thin cassava flour</li>
            <li>1/2 a cup of vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1 pepperoni, chopped into cubes <span class="optional">(optional)</span></li>
            <li>2 white onions, finely chopped</li>
            <li>1 garlic clove, crushed</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon of salt</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon of colorau</li>
          </ul>
          <ol class="recipe-steps">
            <li>Heat up the oil in a large, deep pot. Medium heat.</li>
            <li>When the oil gets hot, add in the onions and sauté them until they’re fried up and see-through.</li>
            <li>Add in the garlic and the salt.</li>
            <li>As the garlic is sautéed, add in the colorau.</li>
            <li>Add in the flour.</li>
            <li>Turn down the heat to low.</li>
            <li>Stir it non stop for 1-2 minutes. Do not leave your farofa be, as it can burn easily. <strong>Keep stirring!</strong></li>
            <li>As you make sure it is well mixed, turn off the heat.</li>
            <li><strong>Do not</strong> cover your farofa until it’s completely cooled.</li>
            <li>After cooled down, put it in a container for storage. Enjoy with any and every meal!</li>
